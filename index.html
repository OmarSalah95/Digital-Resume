        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            A conscientious, fast learner offering the ability to assess read, edit, and append code to
            help create a robust web presence. I understand and have experienced all 7 stages of the
            web development process including: information gathering, planning, design, development,
            testing, delivery and maintenance. I am proficient with a wide array of programming languages
            and tools.

      <h2>Relevant Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Git Version Control</h3>
          <p> I have experience using git and the git work flow for controlling source code versioning.
            I have a thorough understanding of the whole process from forking the original repo to my local machine,
            to testing and merging with the master branch. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Vanilla HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript</h3>
          <p> I learned the Web Development basics starting with the lowest level of web languages to build off of. I
            did this in consideration that all frameworks and new technologies in this rapidly developing field, are built
            off of and used to abstract the 3 base languages of the Web.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Speed Learning</h3>
          <p>I am a huge fan of learning. In my free time I find myself researching and learning new skills. Like with
            everything in life practice has made me a more efficient faster learner. This is a huge asset in the rapidly
            developing world of technology and programming as a new language or framework comes out almost daily.
